	I am a Technology Sr. Analyst at Accenture, the Los Angeles office. During my time at the company, I have worked on various projects in telecommunications and banking, where I learned about home networking, television, and anti money laundering. Along side with my industry learning, I gained experience in developing business requirements, managing product development, and creating mobile applications/websites etc. One of my favorite projects was designing an internet product for the world's largest media corporation. I am passionate about consumer facing products and always seek out opportunities to be part of the product design team.

	<p>Before Accenture, I received a B.S. in Chemical Engineering from The University of Texas at Austin, and completed a number of engineering internships in Oil & Gas. Through my experience, I've built a strong foundation in problem solving, critical thinking, and independent learning, and I am known for quick acclimation to new environments and delivering quality work under aggressive timelines.

	<p>In my free time, I am very active. I enjoy traveling, learning about different culture and exploring different cuisine. Recently in March, I have traveled around the globe, and I took the above pic at Munich. When I am at home, I like to run on the beach and practice yoga.
